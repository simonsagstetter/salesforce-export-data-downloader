## Salesfroce Export Data Downloader
In Salesforce Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions you can schedule a weekly export of your whole salesforce organization data. When the export is finished you can download a zip archive containing all your data from your salesforce setup. With the Salesforce Export Data Downloader you can extend this feature and let a python script download your exported data automatically. All you need to do is to configurate your credentials and organization information and bind the run.py as a task to your windows task scheduler or linux cron job tab.

### Installation

> Download the repository and install the dependencies
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

> Open the config.json and enter your credentials and salesforce organization information. The user needs to have access to the export data home. You can also define an external smtp server for sending a success message.
```json
  {
    "username": "<your_username",
    "password": "<your_password>",
    "security_token": "<your_orgs_security_token>",
    "auth_url": "<your_domain>.my.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/<Version>",
    "org_url": "<your_domain>.my.salesforce.com",
    "sender": "",
    "receiver": "",
    "smtp_host": "",
    "smtp_port": "",
    "smtp_user": "",
    "smtp_password": ""
  }
```

### Download

> If your configuration is done you can already test the downloader by executing the run.py script. 
> MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS AN EXPORT AVAILABLE IN YOUR EXPORT DATA HOME!

```
  python run.py
```
